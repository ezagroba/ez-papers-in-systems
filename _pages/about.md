Papers in Systems is a friendly virtual journal club about systems. Folks with varied experience and interest in systems, bringing in insights, experience and connections to other work. Anyone is welcome regardless of background. We meet monthly to discuss a paper (or blog post, or book, etc).

Sessions are scheduled for 1 hour and typically include a presentation of the paper's main ideas along with open community discussion. We meet on Zoom and take collective notes on a Miro board.

Have a paper to suggest for a future session? Get in touch with an organizer!

Papers in Systems is hosted by <a href="https://www.ruthmalan.com/">Ruth Malan</a> and an active community of participants.
