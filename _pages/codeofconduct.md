title: Code of Conduct
---

Our participation here reflects our mutual agreement and commitment to each other to follow this code of conduct during our discussion today. It applies equally to all of us (including facilitators).

- We share a commitment to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming meeting experience for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
- Please be kind and courteous. Please avoid using terms that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that our discussions will reflect different perspectives, trade-offs and impacts. There is seldom a right answer.
- Should anyone insult, demean or harass others in this setting, they will be excluded from interaction (contact the facilitators, if this happens). That is not welcome behavior.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

Note: We have adapted this code of conduct from the Ruby Code of Conduct.
