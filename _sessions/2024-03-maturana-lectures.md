Chilean biologist [Humberto Maturana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humberto_Maturana) was an important 20th century systems theorist and, along with Francisco Varela, inventor of the concept of autopoieis, a self-producting and self-maintaining system.

> In this set of YouTube videos based on material filmed at The Open University in 1997 the late Prof. Humberto Maturana discusses some of his key ideas. The segments come from an edited conversation between Humberto Maturana and Prof. Ray Ison , Professor of Systems at the OU. Prof Raul Espejo who worked with Humberto in Chile during the Allende years and later held chairs at Aston and Lincoln Universities and is the current Director General of WOSC (the World Organisation of Systems & Cybernetics ) was also present and contributes to the conversation. The original filming was probably on Wednesday 12th March 1997.
